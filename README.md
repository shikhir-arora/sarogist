# sarogist

### Just a basic OAuth2 to get an access token to allow an app to post Gist's on your behalf.. 

- Used mostly for overflow for [Discord](https://discordapp.com) related bots.
- Access-Token is secure, follows the GitHub Developer API guidelines for these kinds of applications (over the basic/personal authentication token method)
- ..anything that posts automatically must send a User-Agent, content requirements, and proper origin info as well as abide by any ratelimits, spam policies, etc. OAuth2 is technically required for automated actions (like a bot posting a Gist) :)
- *Nothing* fancy at all here. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  ***...move along...***
